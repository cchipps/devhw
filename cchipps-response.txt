What was the goal and what were the requirements?
A simple jQuery Reddit Consumer that uses only jQuery and api to consume a Reddit page.
Requirements: no database, light code, css, js, and use Reddit api, 8 hours total time to spend on example. 
How does the work meet (or not meet) the goal and requirements? 
All objectives met. 
How does it work? (big picture: think about how you would describe this to someone who was going to review the code or add functionality, to get them started)
Speaking to someone who was going to review the code, I would be refined in steps to install and use. I would also describe results and set expectations. Download the repository browse to the index.html page and open in a web browser. 
Who did you work on this with, and which parts were you responsible for? (If there is no commit or ticket history to review, please be very explicit here)
I completed all of the custom work on this repository.  
If you were to do it again, what would you do differently? OR If you could spend more time, what would you add/improve?
I completed this project in less than 2 hours, I would add tests and improve navigation. 
How do I run this code on my own web server so I can try it out?
Yes, web server not necessary! Please test away!
